# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school, is working on the analysis of the standardized test performance of students from the schools in the district.
This data and analysis will be used by a School Board to make their decisions about budget allocation and other important matters.

There was a report that there was a fraud with the test performance of 9th grade students from Thomas High School so we corrected the dataset by replacing the corresponding scores with NaN.

## Results:

### Trends & Insights
Based on the corrected dataset, the below trends were found.
* We can't see strong correlation between scores and grades, which means that higher grade students don't necessarily score higher than lower grade students.
* Regarding the spending per capita and scores, schools with lower budget seem to perform better at tests, which means that allocating more budget doesn't boost the performance and we should think of better ways to improve performance.
* Regarding the school size and scores, we can observe that there is no much difference between small and medium schools, however large schools score lower than small and medium schools especially at a math test. This probably is because that bigger schools cannot provide personalized and thorough support with each student because there are too many students.

## Summary:

* However, as the size of 9th graders of Thomas High School is relatively small compared to the total number of students in the district, thus, it didn't affect general trends that can be observed in other data.
